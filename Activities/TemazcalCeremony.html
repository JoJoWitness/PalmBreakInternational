        <h3>Temazcal Ceremony</h3>
        <p>A Tezmacal ritual is a traditional Mayan ceremony of purification which takes place in a tiny hut. You strip down to your underwear (or swimsuit), then enter the sweat lodge which is heated with hot rocks & water, turning it into a steamy sauna.</p>
        <p>The ceremony is led by a local shaman, who conducts the ritual and takes care of participants. The tezmacal ceremony takes place in complete darkness, as the shaman pours water over the hot rocks, chanting and using different herbs to summon spirits.</p>
        <p>Temazcal was performed since ancient times, is seen as a purification ceremony that cleans the body, mind, and soul. As your body is sweating in the tiny hut, you enter a deep state of meditation, enhanced by the shamanic chanting.</p>
