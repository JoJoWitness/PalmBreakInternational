        <h4>Temazcal Massage</h4>
        <p>Temazcal ceremony is a Mexican sweat lodge that originated with the ancient people whom habituated Mexico. The ceremony is in a sauna or sweat lodge and traditionally performed by a shaman who gives you a heated massage using scented herbs. It can used to heal certain ailments and improve health.</p>
        <h4>Thai Massage</h4>
        <p>The Thai massage originated in Thailand, and many people describe as a mix between yoga and massage. It uses stretching and slow, rhythmic compression along the bodyâ€™s energy lines, known as sens. Thai massage therapists use many parts of their body - their thumbs, palms, elbows, and even feet and knees - to pull, press, and stretch the body. This is done to loosen the joints and relax the body. Also, it is said to unblock energy along the sen pathways.</p>
        <h4>Indonesian Massage</h4>
        <p>In Javanese massage, pushing and stroking techniques predominate, working to ease muscle and joint pain. It relies upon deep thumb pressures: pushing, pressing and circling along and around the body's energy meridians to break down tensely knotted muscles; and to stimulate the body's lymphatic system into releasing its self-regenerative power. The deep thumb pressure is accompanied with simultaneous stroking palm movements to improve blood circulation, relives tension, relax the muscles and release stress.</p>
