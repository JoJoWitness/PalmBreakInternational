        <p>Atlantic City draws tourists by the car- and bus-load, topping more than 20 million visitors per year! Stroll along the famous Boardwalk with its numerous amusements and eateries or visit the historic Absecon Lighthouse and the new Wheel at Steel Pier. Several championship golf courses are within a 30 minute drive to attract golf enthusiasts. In summer, the local free beaches are popular with families.

Water-based activities include parasailing, charter fishing and dolphin-watching cruises. Casino hoppers have 9 establishments to choose from and there is something for everyone's taste.
