        <h3>Breckenrige CO - United States</h3>
        <p>For outdoors enthusiasts, mentioning the famous mountain town Breckenridge, Colorado, conjures up images of legendary skiing, scenic hiking, epic mountain biking and trophy-winning trout fishing. Founded during the Gold Rush of the mid-1800s, Breckenridge has retained its pioneer, mining-town feel while playing up its enviable natural beauty and adventure-oriented activities.</p>
        <p>With 762 centimeters of snow annually and nearly 1,200 hectares of ski terrain on five towering peaks, Breckenridge Ski Resort earned its place on every ski fanatic’s bucket list. From November to April – one of the longest ski seasons in the USA – ride the highest chair lift in North America to reach meticulously groomed trails and four thrilling terrain parks to practice your stunts. Breckenridge’s best-kept secret is its spring ski season, which extends into mid-to late-April. Lift and accommodation rates are lower, crowds have thinned out, springtime festivals have started and the mild weather makes for fabulously sunny days and easy-to-ski snow.</p>
