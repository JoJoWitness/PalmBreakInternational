        <h3>Nassau - The Bahamas</h3>
        <p>The Bahamas are located north of the Greater Antilles and southeast of Florida, technically the location of the Bahamas is in the North Atlantic Ocean, and not in the Caribbean, but the Bahamas are sometimes encompassed as Caribbean islands. A significant percentage of those islands are technically cays, or coral reef islands, and most are uninhabited. The name "Bahamas" comes from Spanish, and translates to "shallow waters." More than 300,000 people live here, making it a relatively populous country. Since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1973, the Bahamas have flourished. Tourism, in particular, is the main thing driving the economy here, so the locals tend to cater to visitors and are very welcoming.</p>
